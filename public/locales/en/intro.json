        "text": "According to VTsIOM polls, 95% of Russians dream of going somewhere, but only 36% plan to spend their holidays in their native country. Like, what haven't we seen here at home? In fact, Russia is a whole universe with the gentle sea of the south, the dense forests of the Sayan Mountains and the harsh ice of the Putorana plateau. And you can also see all these beauties without millions in your account, a passport and many hours of flights. Like, for example, Vera Bashmakova, a brave young mother who took three children in her arms, put them in her Lada and drove 20 thousand kilometers across her native country. We have selected and described some interesting places worthy of your vacation.",
